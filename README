FUNCTIONS 
A block of reusable code used to perform specific tasks 

Variables
Data Types
Operators
If statements
Data Structures
Loops 
Functions 


Why Use Functions?
1. Code Reusability
2. Modularity - breaking large codebase into smaller managaebale pieces or modules
3. Readability & Organization
4. Easier debugging - catch and solve errors betterr
5. Better scaling


Python functions -> syntax ->
def function_name:
    //function body


def add_numbers(a,b):   ---> function definition
def test_functions():
function defintion -> def keyword, 
                -> function signature(name of your function + whether the function has parameters   or not )

-> parameter - placeholder values
-> arguments - real values

add_numbers(number1,number2). -> function call -> pass arguments

function definition
function body
function call

functions are used with return keyword 
return keyword -> return some value from a function. && signify the end of a function


Global vs Local Variables 
Global Variable - a variable that can be accessed anywhere in the program
Local Variable - are variables that are only accessible in their local/block scope


Function 
Methods - functions attached to classes - OOP -Object Oriented Programming - classes and objects


Types of functions
1.Inbuilt functions - come with the progamming language and have predefined tasks e.g print()
2.user defined functions - created by the programmer - > def add_numbers():




1.Python - functions, lists ,tuples , data types
2.sql - queries 



Create a new project called MyDuka 
-main.py 
-database.py

-> Open a new terminal and run the following commands to install the packages below
1. pip install flask
2. pip install psycopg2-binary

Why use Functions?
1. Reusability
2. Code organization and readability
3. Modularity - breaking large code into smaller manageable pieces or modules
4. Easier debugging - catch  errors better and faster

Types of Functions:
1.Inbuilt functions - come with the programming language and are meant to do specific predefined tasks
    -range() -print()
2.User-defined functions - are created by the user for their use - def calculate()

**parameter -> temporary/placeholder variables / values in the function
**return -> returns some value from a function call and signifies the end of a function
**arguments -> real values passed to a function when calling it

**Global variables - variables that are accessible from anywhere in the program
**Local variables - variables that are only accessible in their local / block scope


Internet - network of networks
web/www -> service that runs on the internet that enables us to connect to the internet
Uses http && https to run requests and transfer data

https://meet.google.com/dsh-idtb-oqb

http & https -> transfer protocols -> establish communication and transfer data over a network

http - not secure -packets / data can be tampered with
https - data encryption -> 

Server - a computer that accepts requests

Build your application
Host it on a server
Ip address is assigned to that application 

Ip address is a number used to uniquely identify a device on a network e.g 142.111.12.82
Domain - user friendly name attached to an ip aaddress used to identify devices / applications

Safaricom - build application - safaricom.co.ke
-host it on a server
-ip address assigned to application e.g  142.111.12.82
-attach a domain name to ip address -> www.google.com
DNS

Find an ip address using domain -> ping 



PSYCOPG2

Is a PostgreSQL adapater for Python . A driver - connects your Python code to a Postgres database

 psycopg2.connect(). - creates a connection between Python and a Postgres database


create database myduka_db;
\c myduka_db


insert into products(name,buying_price,selling_price)values('bread',50,60);

host -> where is my db located 
**localhost -> your computer/device  127.0.0.1

port -> where exactly on my device is the Postgres service running
**5432 -> default Postgres port

user & password -> used to authenticte a postgres user and grant them access to a Postgres database

dbname - Postgres database you're connecting to

cur -> object used to execute sql queries or perform db operations
cur.execute() -> executes an sql query

Insert 2 sales and view them using psycopg2

N/B:- List of tuples

CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    buying_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (buying_price >= 0),
    selling_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (selling_price >= 0)
);

CREATE TABLE stock (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
